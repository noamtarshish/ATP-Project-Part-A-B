üéÆ Advanced Maze Game Project (Part A + Part B)

Welcome to the Advanced Maze Game repository, a project developed during my academic studies in the Advanced Topics in Programming in Java course. This repository is divided into two parts: Part A and Part B, each showcasing different aspects of the maze game.

üîç Part A - Maze Algorithms and Game Logic
Part A focuses on the foundation of the maze game. It includes the implementation of various maze generation algorithms, enabling the creation of intricate and challenging mazes. Additionally, you'll find the game logic that allows players to navigate through the generated mazes, providing an engaging gaming experience.

üîÑ Part B - Streams, Threads, and Maze Compression
In Part B, the project takes a deeper dive into advanced Java concepts. It demonstrates the usage of Java Streams to efficiently process maze data, providing seamless interactions with the game. Threads are employed to enhance performance and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth gaming experience. Furthermore, the maze compression techniques implemented using design patterns, such as decorator and observer, allow for reduced memory footprint while maintaining gameplay quality.

üöÄ Join the Maze Adventure!
This repository serves as a testament to my journey in mastering Java programming and showcases my dedication to applying theoretical knowledge into practical projects. Feel free to explore the code, learn from the implementations, and provide valuable feedback. Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are all welcome as I continue to improve this project.
