/**This class implements the Best First Search algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm that evaluates nodes
 * based on their estimated distance to the goal state. It extends the BreadthFirstSearch class and overrides its
 * getDataStructure method to return a PriorityQueue instead of a LinkedList, which is used to order the nodes based on their
 * heuristic values. The algorithm iteratively selects the node with the lowest heuristic value and expands its children,
 * updating their heuristic values and adding them to the priority queue. This process continues until the goal state is found
 * or the priority queue is empty, indicating that there is no solution.
